## Copy content of current branch to a new branch

If I'm on `main` (or some `old_branch`) and I forget to create a new branch before I start working on something, I can do this to copy the contents of `main` to a new branch (ex. `new_branch`) and then switch to that, assuming I haven't committed anything yet.

```bash copy
git checkout -b new_branch old_branch
```

## Pull changes back into local branch

An example would be when I have an open PR, I merge another PR _into_ that open one, and now I want to pull everything from the open PR back into my local.

```bash {3}
git pull origin pull/_prNumber_/head

ex. git pull origin pull/177/head
```

## Open a pull request

```bash copy
gh pr create
```

## Apply a specific stash

After `git stash list` to see the list of stashes, you can apply a specific one by using the following command:

```bash {3} copy
git stash apply stash@{n}
```

Take a list of stashes for example using `git stash list`:

```bash {2}
stash@{0}: WIP on cdt-example-branch: 61a67951 new base url
stash@{1}: WIP on cdt-example-branch: 1c09c67a add favicon
stash@{2}: WIP on cdt-example-branch: 866ab427 swap images
```

If you want the middle stash, you can use the following command:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{1}
```
